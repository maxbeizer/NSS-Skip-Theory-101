<h1>Skip Music Theory 101</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is the first "resume" project as part of the RoR module
of the Nashville Software School. The project is to be written entirely
in Ruby, using only the Standard Library (the "colorize" gem was also allowed/
added).</p>

<p>The idea behind this particular project is to create a program that
incorporates basic Western Music theory for educational purposes.The 
goal is for the user to gain a better fundamental understanding of
music theory and for the author to gain better fundamental
understanding of Ruby.</p>

<h2>Feature List</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enter a chord name and get its notes.</li>
<li>Enter a scale and get its notes.</li>
<li>Quizzes on all above topics.</li>
